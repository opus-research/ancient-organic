# ancient-organic

Organic 1.0, which we nicknamed as Ancient Organic, was designed to help programmers in identifying design problems in the source code of Java projects using code smell agglomerations. 
For detecting code smells, Organic 1.0 rely on the smell detection engine from the JSpIRIT tool, which also use agglomerations for prioritizing code smells.
